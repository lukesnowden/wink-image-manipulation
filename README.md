# Wink Image Manipulation

This package is aimed to provide simple support for image manipulation for [Mohamed Said's](https://twitter.com/themsaid) [Wink](https://github.com/writingink/) publishing package.

Under the hood it uses [PHP League's Glide API](https://glide.thephpleague.com/1.0/api/quick-reference/) which you can pass all parameters through to.

## Install
```
composer require lukesnowden/wink-image-manipulation:^v0.0.1
```

## Apply to custom model

Create a new model to extend the default WinkPost model.


```php
<?php

namespace App;

use Wink\WinkPost;
use WinkImageManipulation\Traits\ImageManimulation;

class BlogPost extends WinkPost
{

    use ImageManipulation;

    /**
     * @var array
     */
    protected $images = [
        'winkListingImage' => [
            'w' => 400,
            'h' => 300,
            'fit' => 'crop'
        ],
        'winkHeaderImage' => [
            'w' => 1680,
            'h' => 916,
            'fit' => 'crop'
        ]
    ];

}
```

Define all your images parameters in the `$images` property. Please make sure all named definitions begin with `wink` and end with `Image`.

You can then use definitions as model methods in your views;

```blade
<img src="{{ $post->winkListingImage() }}" />
{{-- https://example.test/image/750e57d1-288d-4b3e-9bf2-ae6b5a397e59/9bd8353c2ead08643d7676681b51c3c3b247936f/winkListingImage --}}
```

## No Featured Image

By default, if no featured image is attached to the Wink Post then a placeholder provided by placehold.it is used. You can override this if required by defining a `placeholderImage` method on your model.

```php
<?php

namespace App;

use Wink\WinkPost;
use WinkImageManipulation\Traits\ImageManimulation;

class BlogPost extends WinkPost
{

    use ImageManipulation;

    ...

    /**
     * @return string
     */
    protected function placeholderImage(): string
    {
        return 'https://placeimg.com/%s/%s/any';
    }

}
```
